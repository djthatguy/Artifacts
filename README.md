<h1 align="center">Mad Libs</h1>

<h3 align="center">In 2022, as part of a collaborative group project for my Intro to Python class, I helped create a mad libs game that I am particularly proud of. The artifact I present here is a demonstration of my programming skills, my ability to work in a team, and my creativity.

The process of creating the mad libs game was not without its challenges. It required a few attempts and a lot of collaboration, but we ultimately settled on a code that was both efficient and streamlined. Our code allowed us to create a Mad Libs game in a Python console, which took in word prompts from a separate text file. This added an element of randomness and surprise to the game, making it more enjoyable for the players.

I have included this artifact in my project portfolio because it represents a significant achievement for me and my group. The satisfaction we derived from creating it is a testament to our passion for programming and our willingness to work together to improve our skills.

Moreover, this artifact highlights our capabilities as programmers, specifically in our familiarity with the Python programming language and our ability to work as a team to create a completed task. The mad libs game also showcases our creativity in coming up with unique and entertaining word prompts.

Overall, the mad libs game we created for our Intro to Python class in 2022 is a testament to our dedication, teamwork, and skill as programmers. It is an artifact that I am proud to include in my project portfolio, and I believe it will serve as evidence of my abilities to prospective employers or collaborators.</h3>
