<h1 align="center">Mad Libs</h1>

<h3 align="center">In 2022, as part of a collaborative group project for my Intro to Python class, I helped create a mad libs game that I am particularly proud of. The artifact I present here is a demonstration of my programming skills, my ability to work in a team, and my creativity.

The process of creating the mad libs game was not without its challenges. It required a few attempts and a lot of collaboration, but we ultimately settled on a code that was both efficient and streamlined. Our code allowed us to create a Mad Libs game in a Python console, which took in word prompts from a separate text file. This added an element of randomness and surprise to the game, making it more enjoyable for the players.

I have included this artifact in my project portfolio because it represents a significant achievement for me and my group. The satisfaction we derived from creating it is a testament to our passion for programming and our willingness to work together to improve our skills.

Moreover, this artifact highlights our capabilities as programmers, specifically in our familiarity with the Python programming language and our ability to work as a team to create a completed task. The mad libs game also showcases our creativity in coming up with unique and entertaining word prompts.

Overall, the mad libs game we created for our Intro to Python class in 2022 is a testament to our dedication, teamwork, and skill as programmers. It is an artifact that I am proud to include in my project portfolio, and I believe it will serve as evidence of my abilities to prospective employers or collaborators.</h3>

<h1 align="center">Function Test Case</h1>

<h3 align="center">Additionally in 2022, I created a function test case for my Intro to Python class, which I am proud to present as an artifact that demonstrates my programming skills. Although the task was relatively simple compared to my previous projects, it allowed me to showcase my proficiency in Python and my ability to create a function that analyzes data.

The code I created was designed to pass given test cases, and it took a dictionary of statistics as input. It analyzed the number of views and likes of a TikToker to determine whether or not they are famous, and returned a true statement accordingly. While the code was straightforward, it required me to think critically about the logic and syntax of the function.

I have included this artifact in my project portfolio because it is one of the pieces of code that I understood the most during my studies. I am proud of my ability to write clean, concise, and effective code, which is evident in the function test case. Furthermore, the artifact serves to highlight my skills in working with dictionaries, which is a valuable tool in data analysis.

In conclusion, the function test case I created for my Intro to Python class in 2022 is a testament to my programming skills and my ability to analyze data using Python. Although it may seem like a simple task, the ability to write clean, concise, and effective code is an essential skill for any programmer. I am proud to include this artifact in my project portfolio and believe that it showcases my capabilities to prospective employers or collaborators.</h3>
