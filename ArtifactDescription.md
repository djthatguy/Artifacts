<h3 align="center">Information about two projects I have done</h3>


<h1 align="center">Mad Libs</h1>

<h3 align="center">In 2022, as part of a collaborative group project for my Intro to Python class, I helped create a mad libs game that I am particularly proud of. The artifact I present here is a demonstration of my programming skills, my ability to work in a team, and my creativity.

The process of creating the mad libs game was not without its challenges. It required a few attempts and a lot of collaboration, but we ultimately settled on a code that was both efficient and streamlined. Our code allowed us to create a Mad Libs game in a Python console, which took in word prompts from a separate text file. This added an element of randomness and surprise to the game, making it more enjoyable for the players.

I have included this artifact in my project portfolio because it represents a significant achievement for me and my group. The satisfaction we derived from creating it is a testament to our passion for programming and our willingness to work together to improve our skills.

Moreover, this artifact highlights our capabilities as programmers, specifically in our familiarity with the Python programming language and our ability to work as a team to create a completed task. The mad libs game also showcases our creativity in coming up with unique and entertaining word prompts.

Overall, the mad libs game we created for our Intro to Python class in 2022 is a testament to our dedication, teamwork, and skill as programmers. It is an artifact that I am proud to include in my project portfolio, and I believe it will serve as evidence of my abilities to prospective employers or collaborators.</h3>

<h1 align="center">Webscraper</h1>

<h3 align="center">In 2022, I created a webscraper for my Intro to Python class that I am particularly proud of. The artifact I present here is a demonstration of my programming skills and my ability to work with Python effectively.

Initially, creating the webscraper was a challenging task that required several attempts. However, I persevered and was eventually able to write it in a way that was both convenient and efficient. The code allowed me to extract specific information from the University of Maryland iSchool Alumni website page, a task that would have been time-consuming and tedious without the webscraper.

I have included this artifact in my project portfolio because it represents a significant achievement for me. The satisfaction I derived from creating it is a testament to my passion for programming and my willingness to push myself to improve my skills.

Moreover, this artifact highlights my capabilities as a programmer, specifically in my familiarity with the Python programming language. The webscraper showcases my ability to work with libraries, parse web pages, and extract relevant data. These skills are highly valuable in today's job market, particularly in the fields of data analysis and web development.

This webscraper I created for my Intro to Python class is a testament to my dedication, persistence, and skill as a programmer. It is an artifact that I am proud to include in my project portfolio, and I believe it will serve as evidence of my abilities to prospective employers or collaborators. Additionally it will show my ability to construct functional codes that can accomplish the task I set for them.</h3>

<h1 align="center">Function Test Case</h1>

<h3 align="center">Additionally in 2022, I created a function test case for my Intro to Python class, which I am proud to present as an artifact that demonstrates my programming skills. Although the task was relatively simple compared to my previous projects, it allowed me to showcase my proficiency in Python and my ability to create a function that analyzes data.

The code I created was designed to pass given test cases, and it took a dictionary of statistics as input. It analyzed the number of views and likes of a TikToker to determine whether or not they are famous, and returned a true statement accordingly. While the code was straightforward, it required me to think critically about the logic and syntax of the function.

I have included this artifact in my project portfolio because it is one of the pieces of code that I understood the most during my studies. I am proud of my ability to write clean, concise, and effective code, which is evident in the function test case. Furthermore, the artifact serves to highlight my skills in working with dictionaries, which is a valuable tool in data analysis.

To sum it all up, the function test case I created for my Intro to Python class in 2022 is a testament to my programming skills and my ability to analyze data using Python. Although it may seem like a simple task, the ability to write clean, concise, and effective code is an essential skill for any programmer. I am proud to include this artifact in my project portfolio and believe that it showcases my capabilities to prospective employers or collaborators.</h3>
